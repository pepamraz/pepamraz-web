## How to run development
(this part is mainly for me but feel free to try it yourself)
To run the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
4. To enable the Tailwind CSS build process, run the following command:
    ```
    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
    ```
## How to deploy
1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run deploy`

Remember to keep the development server running while making changes to the code.
